### 2. Get OpenWeatherMap API Key

- To fetch real-time weather data, you need an API key from OpenWeatherMap.

## 🔑 How to Get the API Key:
 - Go to https://openweathermap.org/api
 - Sign up for a free account
 - Once logged in, navigate to the API Keys section under your profile
 - Copy your default API key or generate a new one

### ⚙️ Add Your API Key to the Project
- Open the file script.js
- Locate the following line:

```javascript
const apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";
```

### Replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your actual API key:

```javascript
const apiKey = "your_actual_api_key_here";
```

⚠️ Important: The app won't work without a valid API key. Make sure you replace the placeholder with your real key.
